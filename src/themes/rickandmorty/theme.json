        "403": "FORBIDDEN! *burp* Oh, that's rich! These humans create CONTENT and then FORBID people from seeing it!",
        "404": "*burp* Classic human error, Morty! The page is NOT FOUND! You know why? Because their pathetic FILING SYSTEMS are based on HIERARCHY instead of quantum-entangled neural networks!",
